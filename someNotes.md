About developing your own app:  
  
- To change version of app -> edit `.yaml`
- Not forget to edit dependencies for C++ and resources in `.pro`
- The name of the app could be changed in `.desktop` (line `Name =`)
- To add an image in QML code you can place picture or folder with pictures in `/qml` (Link will be: '../image.png' or '../images/image.png')
